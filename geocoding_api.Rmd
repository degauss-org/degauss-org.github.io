title: "Using DeGAUSS as a Geocoding API"
---

For users wanting more control over the raw geocoding results and address formatting, the geocoding "engine" behind the batch processing in `ghcr.io/degauss-org/geocoder` can be programmatically called one address at a time:

Start the geocoding container in the background and override its entrypoint:

```sh
docker run -it -d --name gs --entrypoint=/bin/bash ghcr.io/degauss-org/geocoder:3.4.0
```

Then geocode a specific address string and get the results in JSON:

```sh
docker exec gs ruby /app/geocode.rb "3333 Burnet Ave Cincinnati OH 45229"
```

After the geocoding process is complete, stop and remove the container:

```sh
docker stop gs
docker rm gs
```

This process can be scripted; for example, in the R package [OfflineGeocodeR](https://github.com/geomarker-io/OfflineGeocodeR).

*Note:* For DeGAUSS geocoder versions <=3.1.0, replace the path to the ruby file (`/app/geocode.rb`) in the `docker exec` command with `/root/geocoder/geocode.rb`.
