title: "Using DeGAUSS as a Geocoding API"
---

For users wanting more control over the raw geocoding results and address formatting, the geocoding "engine" behind the batch processing in `degauss/geocoder` can be programmatically called one address at a time:

Start the geocoding container in the background and override its entrypoint:

```sh
docker run -it -d --name gs --entrypoint=/bin/bash degauss/geocoder:3.0
```

Then geocode a specific address string and get the results in JSON:

For DeGAUSS geocoder <=3.1.0:

```sh
docker exec gs ruby /root/geocoder/geocode.rb "3333 Burnet Ave Cincinnati OH 45229"
```

As of DeGAUSS geocoder >= 3.2.0 (the ruby file moved to /app):

```sh
docker exec gs ruby /app/geocode.rb "3333 Burnet Ave Cincinnati OH 45229"
```

After the geocoding process is complete, stop and remove the container:

```sh
docker stop gs
docker remove gs
```

This process can be scripted; for example, in the R package [OfflineGeocodeR](https://github.com/geomarker-io/OfflineGeocodeR).
