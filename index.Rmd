DeGAUSS (**De**centralized **G**eomarker **A**ssessment for M**u**lti-**S**ite **S**tudies) is a decentralized method for geocoding and deriving community and individual level environmental characteristics while maintaining the privacy of protected health information. It is a standalone and versatile software application based on containerization.  This means that geomarker assessment is reproducible, standardized, and can be computed on at scale. Importantly, DeGAUSS is executable on a local machine -- it does not require extensive computational resources and PHI is never exposed to a third party or the internet, making it ideal for geomarker assessment in a multi-site study.

#### Using DeGAUSS

Get started using DeGAUSS with the [Using DeGAUSS](using_degauss.html) guide. Shown below is a run of a [sample workflow](sample_workflow.html) using DeGAUSS to geocode and add measurements of nearby roadways and greenness to a set of example addresses.
To get started finding the right DeGAUSS image for your project, try using our [menu](http://app.degauss.org/menu/).
