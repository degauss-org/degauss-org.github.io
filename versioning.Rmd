# Reproducibility and Versioning

All of the DeGAUSS containers are versioned for use and you can see the tags on the DockerHub repository pages (e.g. [[https://hub.docker.com/r/degauss/geocoder/tags/]]). All image release versions are synchronized to the GitHub release versions. 

The `latest` tag is an autogenerated tag that always points to the latest release.  For example, when a user pulls or runs `degauss/geocoder`, Docker automatically uses the `latest` tag, `degauss/geocoder:latest`.  It is possible to specify an older version by adding the tag onto the repo/image name, e.g. `degauss/geocoder:v2.2`.  

The changes between versions can be reviewed on GitHub.  For example, you can [compare](https://github.com/cole-brokamp/geocoder/compare/v2.2...master) the changes between `degauss/geocoder:latest` and `degauss/geocoder:v2.2`.
